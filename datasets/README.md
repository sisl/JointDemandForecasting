# Datasets
This README provides instructions for acquiring all datasets used in experiments.

## OpenEI data
Assuming the `datasets` folder is the current working directory, the `OpenEI` dataset can be obtained by running the following command:
```
python3 download_openEI.py
```

It can then be processed by editing and running:
```
python3 process_openEI.py
```
